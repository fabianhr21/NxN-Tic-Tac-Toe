# NxN-Tic-Tac-Toe

A tic tac toe terminal game. Have fun expanding it to a NxN board!

You must install the two .cpp and the one .hpp file on this repository.

To run it, you must enter the following lines on your bash or command prompt:

>> g++ TicTacToe.cpp ttt_fun.cpp

After that, it will create an executable file called a, which you must call on the next line, after calling a, enter a number which indicates the size of the board.
For example; 

>> a 3
  
Will create a 3x3 TicTacToe board.     

Have fun!
